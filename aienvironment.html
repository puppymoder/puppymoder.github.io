        <div class="PostTitle">AI and The Environment, the Pros and Cons</div>
        <div class="PostContainer">
        <div class="PostText">
            AI usage has exploded in the past few years, with it, the computational power needed 
            to train and run these models. AI data centres are popping up across the globe, requiring 
            significant amounts of water and electricity to keep them running.
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Having studied Environmental Science prior to Cyber Security, environmental issues are 
            something I am passionate about, so I wanted to know, do the benefits of artificial intelligence 
            in facing environmental challenges outweigh the costs?
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Part 1 – The Cons
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            A Neural Network is a machine learning model, commonly used alongside Natural Language Processing 
            to give us chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. It is estimated that training models such 
            as these emits ~300,000kg of CO₂, to put this into context, the average car will emit 57,000 kg in 
            its lifetime, five times less than training a single AI model [1]. This number will vary from 
            model to model, however the impact is significant nevertheless.
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            In 2023 data centres consumed 4.4% of the total US electricity, this is expected to rise to 
            between 6.7% and 12% by 2028 [2]. Between September 2023 and August 2024, US data centres produced
             over 105 million tons of CO₂e (carbon dioxide equivalent) with a carbon intensity 48% higher 
             than the national average [3]. So alongside the massive cost of training an AI, the data centres 
             used to keep them running emit huge amounts of CO₂, this is not helped by their inefficiency, 
             with an emission intensity higher than the US average.
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Water consumption is another hot topic regarding AI, whilst it may not reach the levels of 
            industries such as agriculture and energy, the rapid expansion of AI and subsequent water usage 
            is a major cause for concern. A 20-50 question ‘conversation’ with an AI may use up to 500ml of 
            water, factoring in the millions of users daily, this adds up rapidly, further burdening an 
            already strained resource [4]. AI’s projected water usage could reach 6.6 billion m³ by 2027 [5] 
            highlighting the need for drastic improvements in cooling system efficiency. Whilst models for 
            this do exist, it is ultimately up to organisations to implement these new systems.
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Part 2 – The Pros
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Despite the costs, AI is proving pivotal in addressing environmental challenges, being applied 
            in a variety of sectors including natural resource conservation, waste management, clean energy, 
            ecosystem monitoring, and many more [6].
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            AI’s ability to analyse and visualise complex datasets is already being utilised by world 
            leading environmental agencies. UNEP launched the World Environment Situation Room (WESR) in 
            2022, leveraging AI to “curate, aggregate, and visualise the best available earth observation 
            and sensor data to inform near real-time analysis and future predictions”, informing decisions 
            and driving actions on global environmental policy [7]. The applications of this system are vast,
             land-use changes and deforestation can be analysed as they occur, pollution levels, including 
             greenhouse gas emissions, can be easily evaluated to drive change in key areas, even natural 
             disasters can be more reliably predicted to allow for timely action.
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Additional uses of AI in managing environmental risks include identifying changes in icebergs, 
            helping calculate the amount of meltwater released into the ocean due to climate change. The 
            use of AI has increased the speed of this process by 10,000x the previous rate. In a similar 
            vein to this, the Dutch environmental organisation ‘The Ocean Cleanup’ is using AI to identify 
            ocean litter in remote locations, aiding in the collection and removal of ocean waste [8].

            Conclusion
        </div>
        <div class="PostText">
            Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly, despite it’s widespread use we are still in 
            the early stages of this technology. Despite this, it has proven hugely successful in the 
            management of the environmental challenges we face, being successfully used in numerous sectors 
            to combat these issues. Whilst it does create new challenges in terms of carbon emissions and 
            water consumption, I believe that as our understanding of the technology and its requirements 
            improve, these problems can be mitigated, and AI can continue to play a vital role in combating 
            the environmental challenges we face.
